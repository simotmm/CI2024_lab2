# Computational Intelligence - Lab 2: TSP
The goal of this lab is to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem ("TSP", https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) with the given instances (in the "cities" directory) 
using a fast but approximate algorithm and a slower yet more accurate one.

## Results
### Greedy Algorithm
| Instance   | Steps | Cost (km)  |
